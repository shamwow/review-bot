# Contributing LLM Compatibility Guide

This file describes what a code-submitting LLM must do to participate in the review-bot workflow. Copy this file into any project that will create PRs for review-bot to review.

## Supported Platforms

The review bot supports projects using one of the following stacks, detected by file extensions in the diff:

| Stack | Detected by |
|---|---|
| iOS (SwiftUI) | `*.swift` |
| Android (Kotlin/Compose) | `*.kt`, `*.kts` |
| Go webservers | `*.go` |
| React webapps | `*.tsx`, `*.ts`, `*.jsx` |

## Required Project Files

Your repository **must** contain:

### `CLAUDE.md` or `README.md`
Must document the project's **build and test commands**. The review bot runs these before reviewing. If they fail, the PR is rejected immediately with no code review.

Example:
```markdown
## Build
npm run build

## Test
npm run test

## Lint
npm run lint
```

### `ARCHITECTURE.md`
Documents the project's architecture — module structure, data flow, layer boundaries, dependency direction. The review bot reads this during the architecture review pass and checks that PRs conform to it. If your change introduces new modules or alters the architecture, update this file in the same PR.

## Label-Driven Workflow

The entire review cycle is driven by three GitHub labels. Only one label is active on a PR at a time.

| Label | Applied by | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `bot-review-needed` | Code submitter | PR is ready for review |
| `bot-changes-needed` | Review bot | Issues found; submitter must respond |
| `human-review-needed` | Review bot | Bot approved; awaiting human review |

### Lifecycle

```
1. Open PR against main
2. Add label: bot-review-needed
         │
         ▼
   Review bot picks up the PR
         │

    │                    │            │
    │                    ▼            ▼
    │           bot-changes-needed  human-review-needed
    │                    │
    ▼                    ▼
Fix issues and address every review thread
    │
    ▼
Add label: bot-review-needed  (triggers another cycle)
```

## What the Review Bot Checks

The bot runs two sequential review passes:

**Pass 1 — Architecture Review**
- Does the change fit the existing architecture per `ARCHITECTURE.md`?
- Are new modules/layers in the right place?
- Is the data flow correct? Any inappropriate coupling?
- Are dependencies pointing in the right direction?
- Does `ARCHITECTURE.md` need updating?

**Pass 2 — Detailed Code Review**
- Runs the project's linter
- Correctness: logic errors, null safety, edge cases
- Performance: unnecessary allocations, N+1 queries
- Memory management: retain cycles, leaks, uncancelled subscriptions
- Error handling: missing or inadequate error handling
- Security: injection, hardcoded secrets, insecure transport
- Testing: are new code paths tested?

## Responding to Review Comments

When the bot applies `bot-changes-needed`, it will have posted review comments on the PR. Every bot comment (inline review comments and general comments alike) contains a `thread::{uuid}` tag in its footer for tracking purposes. The submitting LLM **must**:

1. **Address every unresolved comment thread** — the bot tracks both inline review threads and general comment threads via `thread::` tags, and will reject the PR if any are left unaddressed.

2. For each thread, either:
   - **Fix the issue** in a new commit and reply to the thread explaining the fix, OR
   - **Justify why no change is needed** by replying to the thread with a clear explanation. The review bot will evaluate justifications on the next cycle and resolve threads it finds acceptable.

3. **Do not** post "REVIEW BOT RESOLVED" — only the review bot uses this phrase to mark threads as resolved.

4. After addressing all threads, **re-apply the `bot-review-needed` label** to trigger another review cycle.

## Build and Test Gate

The review bot runs your project's build and test commands **before** any code review. If they fail:

- The bot posts the failure output as a PR comment
- The PR is labeled `bot-changes-needed`
- No code review is performed

**Always ensure your PR builds and passes tests before applying `bot-review-needed`.**

## PR Best Practices for Review Bot Compatibility

- **Keep PRs focused** — one logical change per PR. The bot reviews the full `git diff main...HEAD`.
- **Update `ARCHITECTURE.md`** if your change introduces new modules, layers, or alters data flow.
- **Include tests** for new code paths — the bot checks for testing gaps.
- **Don't rely on formatting fixes** — the bot defers to the project's linter for style and focuses on substantive issues.
- **Keep build/test commands in `CLAUDE.md` or `README.md` up to date** — the bot uses them as-is.
