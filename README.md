# ironsha

An AI Shahmeer that reviews PRs, writes code to fix review comments, resolves merge conflicts, and iterates until the PR is ready for human review. Will also develop features end-to-end from issue descriptions. Powered by Claude Code or Codex. Supports iOS (SwiftUI), Android (Kotlin/Compose), Go webservers, and React webapps.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A GitHub App (see [Setup](#setup))
- One provider CLI installed, depending on `LLM_PROVIDER`:
  - [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) (`claude` on `PATH`)
  - [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli) (`codex` on `PATH`)

## Setup

### 1. Create a GitHub App

1. Go to **Settings → Developer settings → GitHub Apps → New GitHub App**
2. Set the following permissions:
   - **Repository permissions:**
     - Pull requests: Read & write
     - Issues: Read & write
     - Checks: Read
     - Contents: Read
3. Subscribe to these webhook events:
   - `pull_request`
   - `check_suite`
4. Generate a private key and download the `.pem` file
5. Note your **App ID** from the app settings page
6. Set a **Webhook secret** (a random string you generate)

### 2. Install the App

Install the GitHub App on the repositories (or organization) you want ironsha to work on.

### 3. Configure the environment

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in your `.env`:
```bash
# Required
GITHUB_APP_ID=123456
GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY=/path/to/private-key.pem
GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_secret

# Provider selection
LLM_PROVIDER=claude

# Claude auth (only needed when LLM_PROVIDER=claude)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your_key_here
# Or run `claude login` and leave ANTHROPIC_API_KEY unset
```

### 4. Set the webhook URL

Point your GitHub App's webhook URL to your server (e.g., `https://your-server.com/api/github/webhooks`).

For local development, use [Smee](https://smee.io) — see [Local Development](#local-development).

## Running

Development:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Production:
```bash
npm start
```

| `LOG_LEVEL` | No | `info` | Log level (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`) |

## Provider Notes

- `LLM_PROVIDER=claude` preserves the original behavior: `claude --print` with the existing JSON prompt contract.
- `LLM_PROVIDER=codex` runs `codex exec` non-interactively, injects the same review instructions through Codex developer instructions, and wires the GitHub MCP server per invocation.
- Codex reads `AGENTS.md` natively. ironsha also keeps `CLAUDE.md` as a fallback instruction filename for Codex runs.

## Project Requirements

Reviewed repositories should keep build and test commands in one or more of:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `README.md`

ironsha reads those files in that order, extracts build/test commands, and deduplicates exact command strings before running them.

## How it works

The bot runs as an HTTP server that receives GitHub webhook events. When a PR is labeled, the matching pipeline is dispatched. The three pipelines form an autonomous loop: review → write code → wait for CI → re-review, repeating until the PR passes or hits the cycle limit.

**Review pipeline** (`bot-review-needed`):
1. Clone the PR branch into a temp directory.
2. Run the project's build and test commands from `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or `README.md`.
3. If build/tests pass, run an architecture review pass. If no architecture issues are found, run a detailed review pass.
4. Post review with GitHub's "Request changes" status when issues are found, mark resolved threads with emoji reactions, and swap labels.

**Write pipeline** (`bot-changes-needed`):
1. Enforce the review-cycle limit.
2. Clone the PR branch, fetch base, and resolve merge conflicts through the selected provider.
3. Run one code-fix pass — the agent reads unresolved review comments via GitHub MCP and writes code to address them.
4. Run build/tests as a safety net.
5. If changes pass, commit, push, post thread replies, and swap to `bot-ci-pending`.

**CI handler** (`bot-ci-pending`):
1. Check GitHub Check Runs and Commit Statuses.
2. If CI passes: swap back to `bot-review-needed` for another review cycle.
3. If CI fails: post failure details and swap to `bot-changes-needed` for another fix attempt.

The `check_suite.completed` webhook event notifies ironsha the moment CI finishes — no polling needed.

The cycle continues automatically (review → fix → CI → review) until the PR either passes review (label swaps to `human-review-needed`) or hits `MAX_REVIEW_CYCLES` (label swaps to `bot-human-intervention`).

Every bot comment includes a `thread::{uuid}` footer tag, plus a `review::{uuid}` tag that identifies the review cycle which produced it.

## Local Development

For local development, use [Smee](https://smee.io) to forward webhooks to your machine:

1. Go to https://smee.io/new and copy the channel URL
2. Set `SMEE_URL` in your `.env` to the channel URL
3. Set your GitHub App's webhook URL to the same Smee channel URL
4. Run `npm run dev` — the Smee proxy starts automatically

The dev server uses `tsx --watch`, so source changes restart the bot automatically.

## Testing

- `npm run test` — compiles the project and runs the Node built-in test suite
- `npm run test:integration:mock_llm` — integration tests with mock LLM responses
- `npm run test:integration` — integration tests with real LLM (requires `TEST_GITHUB_TOKEN`)

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the detailed design and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the repository contract expected from submitting agents.
