# ironsha

An AI Shahmeer that reviews PRs, writes code to fix review comments, resolves merge conflicts, and iterates until the PR is ready for human review. Will also develop features end-to-end from issue descriptions. Powered by Claude Code or Codex. Supports iOS (SwiftUI), Android (Kotlin/Compose), Go webservers, and React webapps.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A GitHub Personal Access Token with `repo` and `read:org` scopes
- One provider CLI installed, depending on `LLM_PROVIDER`:
  - [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) (`claude` on `PATH`)
  - [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli) (`codex` on `PATH`)

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file from the example:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Fill in your `.env`:
   ```bash
   # Required
   GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here

   # Provider selection
   LLM_PROVIDER=claude

   # Claude auth (only needed when LLM_PROVIDER=claude)
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your_key_here
   # Or run `claude login` and leave ANTHROPIC_API_KEY unset

   # Codex auth (only needed when LLM_PROVIDER=codex)
   # CODEX_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
   # Or run `codex login`
   ```

The GitHub token must belong to the GitHub account that will post reviews. The bot polls all repos this account owns or collaborates on.

## Running

Development:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Production:
```bash
npm start
```

## Configuration

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Yes | — | GitHub PAT with `repo` and `read:org` scopes |
| `LLM_PROVIDER` | No | `claude` | Which agent CLI to run: `claude` or `codex` |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | No | — | Claude auth. Omit if using `claude login` |
| `CLAUDE_MODEL` | No | `claude-opus-4-6` | Model for Claude runs |
| `CODEX_MODEL` | No | — | Optional model override for Codex runs |
| `MAX_REVIEW_TURNS` | No | `30` | Max agentic turns per review pass. Used by Claude; Codex ignores it |
| `POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | No | `60000` | Polling interval in milliseconds |
| `REVIEW_TIMEOUT_MS` | No | `600000` | Timeout per review agent invocation |
| `MAX_WRITE_TURNS` | No | `50` | Max agentic turns per code-fix pass. Used by Claude; Codex ignores it |
| `WRITE_TIMEOUT_MS` | No | `900000` | Timeout per code-fix agent invocation |
| `MAX_REVIEW_CYCLES` | No | `5` | Max review-fix cycles before requesting human intervention |
| `CI_POLL_TIMEOUT_MS` | No | `600000` | Timeout for CI checks before treating as failure |
| `MERGE_CONFLICT_TIMEOUT_MS` | No | `300000` | Timeout for merge-conflict resolution |
| `WORK_DIR` | No | `/tmp/ironsha` | Directory for cloning PR branches |
| `TRANSCRIPT_DIR` | No | `/tmp/ironsha/transcripts` | Directory for saved agent output, stderr, and per-run metadata |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | No | `info` | Log level (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`) |

## Provider Notes

- `LLM_PROVIDER=claude` preserves the original behavior: `claude --print` with the existing JSON prompt contract.
- `LLM_PROVIDER=codex` runs `codex exec` non-interactively, injects the same review instructions through Codex developer instructions, and wires the GitHub MCP server per invocation.
- Codex reads `AGENTS.md` natively. ironsha also keeps `CLAUDE.md` as a fallback instruction filename for Codex runs.

## Project Requirements

Reviewed repositories should keep build and test commands in one or more of:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `README.md`

ironsha reads those files in that order, extracts build/test commands, and deduplicates exact command strings before running them.

## How it works

The bot polls GitHub every 60 seconds for open PRs with the `bot-review-needed`, `bot-changes-needed`, or `bot-ci-pending` label across all repos the token can access.

**Review pipeline** (`bot-review-needed`):
1. Clone the PR branch into a temp directory.
2. Run the project's build and test commands from `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or `README.md`.
3. If build/tests pass, run an architecture review pass. If no architecture issues are found, run a detailed review pass.
4. Post review with GitHub's "Request changes" status when issues are found, mark resolved threads with emoji reactions, and swap labels.

**Write pipeline** (`bot-changes-needed`):
1. Enforce the review-cycle limit.
2. Clone the PR branch, fetch base, and resolve merge conflicts through the selected provider.
3. Run one code-fix pass — the agent reads unresolved review comments via GitHub MCP and writes code to address them.
4. Run build/tests as a safety net.
5. If changes pass, commit, push, post thread replies, and swap to `bot-ci-pending`.

**CI handler** (`bot-ci-pending`):
1. Check GitHub Check Runs and Commit Statuses.
2. If CI passes: swap back to `bot-review-needed`.
3. If CI fails: post failure details and swap to `bot-changes-needed`.
4. If CI is pending: leave the PR alone until the next poll cycle.

Every bot comment includes a `thread::{uuid}` footer tag, plus a `review::{uuid}` tag that identifies the review cycle which produced it.

## Development Notes

- If you are using Claude as the provider, run ironsha outside a Claude Code session. Nested Claude sessions are blocked.
- `npm run dev` uses `tsx --watch`, so source changes restart the bot automatically.
- `npm run test` compiles the project and runs the Node built-in test suite against the compiled output.

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the detailed design and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the repository contract expected from submitting agents.
